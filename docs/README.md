# Moleculogic Tier 0 Blueprints: Doxorubicin Rescue

This repository contains SEI-generated public blueprints for redesigned Doxorubicin analogs under Moleculogic Tier 0. These compounds are logic-reconstructed to eliminate cardiotoxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.

## ðŸ”¬ Blueprints

- `MDC-DOX-001.json`: Metal-coordinated, redox-buffered analog
- `FDC-DOX-Î±1.json`: Scaffold-redesigned, redox-silent analog

## ðŸ“Š Scoring & Logic Overlay

See `/logic/SEI_overlay_MDC_vs_FDC.csv` for entropy, Topo II selectivity, ROS risk, and tumor/heart ratios.

## ðŸ§  What is Moleculogic?

Moleculogic is a SEI-powered system for blueprinting molecular logic directly into compound design. Every output is traceable, reproducible, and conditionally activatable. Learn more at: [https://metaldrug.com](https://metaldrug.com)
